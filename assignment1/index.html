      <h1>Interactive Experience Review</h1>

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I noticed was the minimal 3d designs that are
          interactive with my mouse censor and the smooth animation of each
          categories when i hover my mouse on it. The color palette was also
          very appealing and family-friendly with a blue, purple and pink theme.
          The name “Luni” was front and center, and the simple navigation made
          it clear that this wasn’t a cluttered site it was designed to be
          straightforward and to the point.
        </p>

          <li>

        <h2>
          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the most engaging part of the website is the interactive
          feature in the "Omada" section, where you can play around with the
          balls. The activity is surprisingly addictive, and it’s clear that a
          lot of thought went into making it feel smooth and enjoyable. I wasn’t
          expecting to find a mini-game on a professional-looking site like
          this, but it was a fun surprise that kept me engaged for much longer
          than I anticipated. What makes this feature particularly interesting
          is that it isn’t just a random interactive element, it’s tied to
          competition and engagement through the leaderboard.

          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scrolling and navigating between sections was my most common action
          throughout the experience. The website is designed in a way that
          naturally encourages browsing rather than deep interaction. The clean
          and minimal layout makes it easy to move from one section to another
          without feeling lost or overwhelmed. Instead of diving into lengthy
          text-heavy pages, I found myself clicking on a section, quickly
          skimming through the content, and then moving to the next one to see
          what else the site had to offer. This created a fluid, almost
          exploratory experience, where I was constantly on the lookout for new
          visuals, animations, or interactive elements.

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It feels like the main goal of the website is to showcase Luni’s brand
          in a way that leaves a strong, polished first impression. The design,
          structure, and content all seem carefully curated to communicate
          professionalism, creativity, and modernity. Rather than being a deep
          dive into the specifics of their work, the site functions as a
          high-level introduction to who they are, what they do, and what they
          stand for. It’s an elevator pitch in website form, not too
          overwhelming, but just enough to spark curiosity and establish
          credibility. For potential employees, the website serves as a
          recruitment tool, showcasing the company as a modern and exciting
          place to work. The presence of the “Career” section hints at growth
          and opportunity, while the interactive and playful elements (like the
          "Omada" game) add a layer of personality to the company.
        </p>

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The site effectively communicates this goal by maintaining a
          minimalist and visually striking design that immediately conveys
          professionalism and modernity. Instead of overwhelming visitors with
          excessive text, dense information, or a cluttered interface, the
          website strategically presents just a few key sections that introduce
          Luni and its work in a concise yet compelling way. This ensures that
          users can absorb the most important aspects of the brand without
          feeling bogged down by unnecessary details. One of the most noticeable
          ways the website achieves this is through its sleek and polished
          design. The layout is clean and well-structured, allowing each section
          to breathe. White space is used effectively to create a sense of
          openness, and this contributes to an overall feeling of sophistication
          and intentionality. The limited use of text ensures that visitors
          focus more on the visuals and interactive elements rather than having
          to read through long paragraphs.

        <h2>
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          The website feels like a place you visit once or twice to get a clear,
          high-level overview of the company rather than a platform designed for
          repeated visits. Its minimalist approach and straight-to-the-point
          content suggest that its primary function is to provide a polished
          first impression rather than to serve as a continuously updated or
          content-rich destination. There isn’t an extensive blog, regularly
          refreshed news updates, or community-driven interactions that would
          encourage frequent returns.

        <h2>
          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The site doesn’t really invite repeat visits. There’s no blog, no
          regularly updated content, nothing interactive that might keep someone
          coming back. It feels more like a one-time stop — something you look
          at to get a feel for who or what Luni is, and then move on. The only
          real prompts for ongoing connection are the links to LinkedIn and
          Twitter, which suggests that if you’re interested in updates or
          staying connected, that’s where you should go. In that way, it feels
          like the site is designed more as a polished intro than something
          built for long-term engagement.

        <h2>
          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The whole look and feel of the site reminds me of modern startup
          websites — especially in tech or design. It’s very clean, with lots of
          white space, nice typography, and smooth transitions. There’s a bit of
          that “Apple vibe” minimal but intentional. It also feels a bit like a
          digital portfolio crossed with a networking profile. The LinkedIn and
          Twitter links make it clear this is aimed at a professional audience,
          not casual browsers. Altogether, it gives off a sleek,
          business-focused energy.

          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It suggests that I should treat this as a professional introduction
          rather than an in-depth exploration. The site feels like a curated
          snapshot, something designed to make a strong first impression rather
          than offer a lot of detail. It’s more about getting a quick, polished
          overview of who they are, what they do, and how to connect, rather
          than digging into case studies, thought leadership, or
          behind-the-scenes content. The layout, visuals, and lack of deeper
          content all reinforce this idea. I’m not being invited to explore or
          spend time, instead, it feels like I’m being guided to skim, absorb
          the key messages, and then move on.

          11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The whole experience feels very polished and professional, which gives
          the impression that Luni is a trustworthy and forward-thinking
          company. The attention to detail, from the clean layout to the smooth
          animations and refined typography, signals that they take their work
          seriously and value high-quality presentation. There’s a clear
          emphasis on design and branding, which suggests that they care about
          not just what they do, but how it’s perceived. That focus on
          aesthetics makes the site feel modern and intentional, like everything
          has been carefully considered. It doesn’t come across as overly
          corporate or sterile, but it also doesn’t lean into being overly
          casual or quirky.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I found the lack of detailed information a little frustrating. The
          site looks great, but it left me with a lot of unanswered questions.
          What specific projects has Luni worked on? What kind of clients do
          they serve? How do they stand out from competitors? I wanted more
          substance behind the style.

        <p>
          The design itself was the most satisfying part. The site is smooth,
          visually appealing, and easy to navigate. There’s no overwhelming
          text, no clunky UI just a well-crafted digital experience. It feels
          high-end and well thought out, which makes a strong impression.
