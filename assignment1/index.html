      <h1>Interactive Experience Review</h1>

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I noticed was the minimal 3d designs that are
          interactive with my mouse censor and the smooth animation of each
          categories when i hover my mouse on it. The color palette was also
          very appealing and family-friendly with a blue, purple and pink theme.
          The name “Luni” was front and center, and the simple navigation made
          it clear that this wasn’t a cluttered site it was designed to be
          straightforward and to the point.

          your discrete actions.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Exploring different sections like "Studio," "Omada," "Career," and
            "Luni life”
          </li>
          <li>
            Interacting with different objects in each sections (balls, punching
            bag, pans”

          3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the most engaging part is where i can play around with the
          balls in the “Omada” section. The activity is surprisingly addictive
          and there is even a leaderboard for the users that score the goals.

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scrolling and navigating between sections. The website is designed in
          a way that encourages browsing rather than deep interaction. I found
          myself clicking on a section, skimming through, and then moving to the
          next one to see if there was more information. Messing around with the
          interactable objects in sections was also really fun.

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It feels like the main goal of the website is to showcase Luni’s
          brand, giving a polished first impression to potential clients,
          employees, or partners. It’s not a deep dive into their work but more
          of a high-level introduction to who they are and what they do. It
          seems like they want to establish credibility quickly rather than
          overwhelm visitors with too much detail.

      <div class="questions">
        <h2>
          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The site communicates this goal by keeping things minimal and visually
          appealing. There’s no unnecessary clutter—just a few key sections that
          introduce Luni and its work. The sleek design, smooth scrolling, and
          subtle animations all reinforce the idea that Luni is a
          forward-thinking company.

        <h2>
          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          It feels like a site you visit once or twice to get an overview of the
          company. Maybe you come back if you’re looking for a job or want to
          check for updates, but it doesn’t feel like something you’d revisit
          regularly. It’s designed more as a digital business card than an
          interactive platform.
